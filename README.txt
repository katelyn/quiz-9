The solution presented here is implemented in Ruby.

Only standard Ruby 2.0 libraries were used to implement the core functionality.

Test Driven Development was used to drive out the functionality. As a result
RSpec version 3.0.0 was used, the only non-standard library used.

Development was done on a BSD system, the instructions below assume:
- A BSD/Linux based operating system is being used
- Ruby 2.0 is installed
- Ruby Gems is installed

To run the program and see the answers to the question run:
ruby report.rb

To run the tests (specs), execute:
1. gem install rspec
2. rspec

The git log has been included in this submission so it is possible
to see development changes over time.
